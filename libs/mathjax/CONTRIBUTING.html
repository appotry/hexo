<h2 id="Reporting-An-Issue">Reporting An Issue</h2>
<p>If you’re about to raise an issue because you think you’ve found a<br>
problem with MathJax, or you’d like to make a request for a new<br>
feature in the codebase, or any other reason, please read this first.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/mathjax/MathJax/issues">MathJax issue<br>
tracker</a> is the<br>
preferred channel for <a href="#bug-reports">bug reports</a>, <a href="#feature-requests">feature<br>
requests</a>, <a href="#change-requests">change requests</a>, and<br>
<a href="#submitting-pull-requests">submitting pull requests</a>, but please<br>
respect the following restrictions:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Please <strong>search for existing issues</strong>. Help us keep duplicate issues<br>
to a minimum by checking to see if someone has already reported your<br>
problem or requested your idea.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Please <strong>do not</strong> use the issue tracker for personal support<br>
requests (use <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/mathjax-users">the MathJax User Group</a>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Please <strong>be civil</strong>. Keep the discussion on topic and respect the<br>
opinions of others. See also our <a href="#conduct">Conduct Guidelines</a></p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="Bug-Reports">Bug Reports</h3>
<p>A bug is a <em>demonstrable problem</em> that is caused by the code in the<br>
repository. Good bug reports are extremely helpful — thank you!</p>
<p>Guidelines for bug reports:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Use the GitHub issue search</strong> — check if the issue has already been<br>
reported.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Check if the issue has been fixed</strong> — look for <a href="https://github.com/mathjax/MathJax/issues?q=is%3Aclosed">closed<br>
issues in the current<br>
milestone</a><br>
or try to reproduce it using the latest <code>develop</code> branch. Please<br>
note that you will need to<br>
<a href="https://docs.mathjax.org/en/latest/web/hosting.html#getting-mathjax-via-git">compile MathJax and make the components</a><br>
in order to test MathJax from the source repository.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Share a live sample of the problem</strong> — without a live page<br>
it is usually impossible to debug problems; see also the <a href="#template">Bug Report<br>
Template</a> below.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Isolate the problem</strong> — a live sample is a starting point<br>
but if you want to speed things up, create a <a href="https://css-tricks.com/reduced-test-cases/">reduced test<br>
case</a>. Be specific<br>
about your setup (browser, OS versions, etc). Use services like<br>
<a href="http://jsbin.com">jsbin</a>, <a href="http://codepen.io">CodePen</a>, or<br>
<a href="http://jsfiddle.com">jsFiddle</a> to make collaboration on minimal<br>
test cases easier for everyone.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Include a screenshot/cast as a last resort</strong> — Is your<br>
issue about a layout or design feature or bug that is hard to reproduce<br>
or isolate? Then please provide a screenshot or screencast. Tools<br>
like <a href="http://www.cockos.com/licecap/">LICEcap</a> or<br>
<a href="http://www.saucelabs.com">SauceLabs</a> allow you to quickly and<br>
easily record a screencasts. If you make it an animated gif, you can<br>
embed it directly into your GitHub issue.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use the <a href="#template">Bug Report Template</a> below or <a href="https://github.com/MathJax/MathJax/issues/new?title=Bug%3A&amp;body=%23%23%23%20Issue%20Summary%0A%0A%23%23%23%20Steps%20to%20Reproduce%0A%0A1.%20This%20is%20the%20first%20step%0A%0AThis%20is%20a%20bug%20because...%0A%0A%23%23%23%20Technical%20details%0A%0A*%20MathJax%20Version%3A%20master%20-%20latest%20commit%3A%20%20INSERT%20COMMIT%20REF%0A*%20Client%20OS%3A%20%0A*%20Browser%3A%20%0A*%20">click this<br>
link</a><br>
to start creating a bug report with the template automatically.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>A good bug report shouldn’t leave others needing to request<br>
more information from you. Be sure to include the details of your environment.</p>
<p><a id="template"></a></p>
<p>Template Example (<a href="https://github.com/MathJax/MathJax/issues/new?title=Bug%3A&amp;body=%23%23%23%20Issue%20Summary%0A%0A%23%23%23%20Steps%20to%20Reproduce%0A%0A1.%20This%20is%20the%20first%20step%0A%0AThis%20is%20a%20bug%20because...%0A%0A%23%23%23%20Technical%20details%0A%0A*%20MathJax%20Version%3A%20master%20-%20latest%20commit%3A%20%20INSERT%20COMMIT%20REF%0A*%20Client%20OS%3A%20%0A*%20Browser%3A%20%0A*%20">click to use</a>):</p>

<h3 id="Feature-Requests">Feature Requests</h3>
<p>Feature requests are welcome. Before you submit one, be sure to have:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Used the GitHub search</strong> to check that the feature hasn’t already<br>
been requested.</li>
<li>Take a moment to think about whether your idea fits with the scope<br>
and aims of the project, or if it might better fit being a <a href="https://github.com/mathjax/MathJax-third-party-extensions">custom<br>
extension</a>.</li>
<li>Remember, it’s up to <em>you</em> to make a strong case to convince the<br>
project’s leaders of the merits of this feature. Please provide as<br>
much detail and context as possible, this means explaining the use<br>
case and why it is likely to be common.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="Change-Requests">Change Requests</h3>
<p>Change requests cover both architectural and functional changes to how<br>
MathJax works. If you have an idea for a new or different dependency,<br>
a refactor, or an improvement to a feature, etc., please be sure to:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Use the GitHub search</strong> to check that someone else didn’t get there first.</li>
<li>Take a moment to think about the best way to make a case for, and<br>
explain what you’re thinking. Are you sure this shouldn’t really be<br>
a <a href="#bug-reports">bug report</a> or a <a href="#feature-requests">feature<br>
request</a>?  Is it really one idea or is it many?<br>
What’s the context? What problem are you solving? Why is what you<br>
are suggesting better than what’s already there?</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="Working-on-MathJax-core">Working on MathJax core</h2>
<p>You want to contribute code? We describe how below.  First, note that<br>
the MathJax source code is in the<br>
<a href="https://github.com/mathjax/MathJax-src">https://github.com/mathjax/MathJax-src</a> repository, not the<br>
<a href="https://github.com/mathjax/MathJax">https://github.com/mathjax/MathJax</a> repository, which contains the<br>
packaged component files for distribution on CDNs and the <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/mathjax">mathjax npm<br>
package</a> (the source code is<br>
included in the <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/mathjax-full">mathjax-full npm<br>
package</a>).</p>
<h3 id="Key-Branches-Tags">Key Branches &amp; Tags</h3>
<p>MathJax uses several permanent branches in the <a href="https://github.com/mathjax/MathJax-src">MathJax source repository</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong><a href="https://github.com/mathjax/MathJax-src/tree/develop">develop</a></strong><br>
is the development branch. All work on the next release happens here<br>
so you should generally branch off <code>develop</code> if you are going to<br>
submit a pull request. Do <strong>NOT</strong> use this branch for a production<br>
site.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><a href="https://github.com/mathjax/MathJax-src">master</a></strong> contains the latest<br>
release of MathJax. This branch may be used in production. Do<br>
<strong>NOT</strong> use this branch to work on MathJax’s source.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>These branches reflect version 3 of MathJax, which is substantially<br>
different from the version 2 codebase.  Version 2 will continue to be<br>
maintained while web sites transition to version 3, with work being<br>
done using the following branches in the <a href="https://github.com/mathjax/MathJax">MathJax distribution<br>
repository</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong><a href="https://github.com/mathjax/MathJax/tree/legacy-v2-develop">legacy-v2-develop</a></strong><br>
is the development branch for changes to the legacy version 2 code.<br>
Any pull requests for version 2 should be branched from here.  Do<br>
<strong>NOT</strong> use this branch for a production site.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><a href="https://github.com/mathjax/MathJax/tree/legacy-v2">legacy-v2</a></strong><br>
is the branch that contains any updates to version 2 following<br>
the release of version 3.  Do <strong>NOT</strong> use this branch to work on<br>
MathJax’s source.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to these branches, MathJax uses tags to identify the<br>
various versions.  These can be checked out to obtain the specified<br>
release; for example, <code>git checkout 2.7.5</code> would get you the files for<br>
version 2.7.5 of MathJax.</p>
<p>Note that version 3 is written in Typescript, and so must be compiled<br>
to obtain usable javascript files, and that the components need to be<br>
built once that is done.  See the<br>
<a href="https://docs.mathjax.org/en/latest/web/hosting.html#getting-mathjax-via-git">documentation</a><br>
for details. For version 2, the source javascript files are not<br>
compressed until a release is made, so you should use the copies in<br>
the <code>unpacked</code> directory during development.</p>
<h3 id="Submitting-Pull-Requests">Submitting Pull Requests</h3>
<p>Pull requests are welcome. If you’re looking to submit a PR for<br>
something that doesn’t have an open issue, please consider <a href="#reporting-an-issue">raising an<br>
issue</a> that your PR can close, especially if<br>
you’re fixing a bug. This makes it more likely that there will be<br>
enough information available for your PR to be properly tested and<br>
merged.</p>
<h5 id="Need-Help">Need Help?</h5>

<h3 id="Testing-and-Quality-Assurance">Testing and Quality Assurance</h3>
<p>If you’re<br>
looking to get involved with the code base and don’t know where to<br>
start, checking out and testing a pull request is one of the most<br>
useful things you could do.</p>
<p>These are some <a href="https://gist.github.com/piscisaureus/3342247">excellent<br>
instructions</a> on<br>
configuring your GitHub repository to allow you to checkout pull<br>
requests in the same way as branches.</p>
<h3 id="Writing-documentation">Writing documentation</h3>
<p>MathJax’s main documentation can be found at <a href="http://docs.mathjax.org">docs.mathjax.org</a>.<br>
The source of the docs is hosted in the<br>
<a href="http://github.com/mathjax/MathJax-docs">mathjax/MathJax-docs</a> repo here on GitHub.</p>
<p>The documentation is generated using<br>
<a href="http://sphinx-doc.org/">Sphinx-doc</a> and hosted on <a href="http://readthedocs.org">Read the<br>
docs</a>.  You can clone the repo and submit pull<br>
requests following the <a href="#submitting-pull-requests">pull-request</a><br>
guidelines.</p>
<h3 id="Translation">Translation</h3>
<p>If you wish to add or update translations of MathJax, please do it on<br>
<a href="https://translatewiki.net/w/i.php?title=Special:Translate&amp;group=out-mathjax-0-all">TranslateWiki.net</a><br>
(and while you’re there you can help other open source projects,<br>
too).</p>
<p>For bug reports and other questions that don’t fit on<br>
<a href="http://TranslateWiki.net">TranslateWiki.net</a>, head over to the<br>
<a href="https://github.com/mathjax/MathJax-i18n">mathjax/mathjax-i18n</a><br>
repository.</p>
<p>The translation files currently are for version 2, as localization<br>
hasn’t been added to version 3 yet.</p>
<h2 id="Conduct">Conduct</h2>
<p>As a NumFOCUS fiscally sponsored project, MathJax is governed by the<br>
<a href="https://numfocus.org/code-of-conduct">NumFOCUS code of conduct</a>,<br>
which we summarize as follows:</p>
<p>We are committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming<br>
environment for all, regardless of gender, sexual orientation,<br>
disability, ethnicity, religion, or similar personal characteristic.</p>
<p>Please be kind and courteous. There’s no need to be mean or rude.<br>
Respect that people have differences of opinion and that every design<br>
or implementation choice carries a trade-off and numerous costs. There<br>
is seldom a right answer, merely an optimal answer given a set of<br>
values and circumstances.</p>
<p>Please keep unstructured critique to a minimum. If you have solid<br>
ideas you want to experiment with, make a fork and see how it works.</p>
<p>We will exclude you from interaction if you insult, demean or harass<br>
anyone.  That is not welcome behaviour. We interpret the term<br>
“harassment” as including the definition in the <a href="https://numfocus.org/code-of-conduct#unacceptable-behavior">Unacceptable<br>
Behavior</a><br>
section of the <a href="https://numfocus.org/code-of-conduct">NumFOCUS code of<br>
conduct</a>; if you have any lack<br>
of clarity about what might be included in that concept, please read<br>
that definition. In particular, we don’t tolerate behavior that<br>
excludes people in socially marginalized groups.</p>
<p>Private harassment is also unacceptable. No matter who you are, if you<br>
feel you have been or are being harassed or made uncomfortable by a<br>
community member, please contact one of the channel ops or any of the<br>
<a href="https://github.com/MathJax/MathJax">MathJax</a> core team<br>
immediately. Whether you’re a regular contributor or a newcomer, we<br>
care about making this community a safe place for you and we’ve got<br>
your back.</p>
<p>Likewise any spamming, trolling, flaming, baiting, or other<br>
attention-stealing behaviour is not welcome.</p>
<p>We also recommend that you read <a href="http://blog.discourse.org/2013/03/the-universal-rules-of-civilized-discourse/">discourse’s<br>
rules</a><br>
for further suggestions on appropriate behavior.</p>
